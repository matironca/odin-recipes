The Odin Proyect - Recipes Lesson

This project is part of "The Odin Project" Foundations Course
I will buy a basic recipe website, putting in practice my skills and knowledge adquired within
the course. I will be dealing with html and it's tags, I will be using anchors, images, lists 
and probably something more.
Also I will become more familiarized  with git and github

I am not a native english speaker so having grammar errors and typos is expected
I use a green over black terminal because I am pretty cool.

Do I need to sign this?
